# Mini Coding Challeneges.

I thought it would be fun to keep track of a few of the code challenges I complete on various coding websites.
It would be especially interesting to revisit them often to refactor, and to take notes on general thoughts about each project, what I liked or didn't like about my solution, etc.

Included are Code Wars challenges (https://www.codewars.com/users/greta) and I plan to include more as I go.
